                            <li>TCS EngiNX is a national level compeitions for Engineering students showcasing a problem solution in a particular field.In out Case it was IOT(Intern of things)</li>
                            <li>There are 3 round in total each round is an elimination round,</li>
                            <li>Round 1: Online Quiz(Maths,General questions, Aptitude)</li>
                            <li>Round 2: Use Case round: given a wide range of topic come up with a problem statement and relavent solution where IOT can be used.</li>
                            <li>Round 3: Video Presentation: Comming up with the architectural aspects of system,Business prespective like cost,physibility,market segment and so on.</li>
                            <li>Round 4: Finals: presentation for explaning our idea and live demonstration of the Proof of concept to experts and industry leaders.</li>

                            <li>Brushed up on the aptitude part and made sure we complete maximum number of questions as there was limit per question.As we were team of 4 each person took up some part of aptitude to work upto I took Numbers,Time and work and arrangement based topics.</li>
                            <li>Brainstormed an idea for every given topics and possible solutions with physibility aspect.Got in depth analysis of each espect of the solution considering the rechnology espect and impact on human lifes.</li>
                            <li>I was the only person who knew photoshop at that point and time so took up the part of designing and presenting our idea in best form of articulation.</li>
                            <li>Video presentation round we needed animations to show how complete system work so I took up the task and designed storyline in game engines representing system in seamless way</li>
                            <li>Once the idea was selected which is DADAS(Drunk and Drowsiness Alert System), we divided the overall system into 2 parts, drowsy and drunk detection, I took up the drunk part as it was fairly complex and I had to tech myself Machine Learning from scratch(We hardly had 15 days to come upwith a working solution).
                                For a Machine learning algorith a very basic requirement is dataset and unfortunatly we were not having any dataset for drunk people to train on neither a pre-trained model.
                                A solution to this was to take up our own sample dataset, I took up the part of colleting sample,data cleaning and making sure they are ready to be feed into ML.
                                As we didn't have any pre-trained model we started with brute force approach in which I explored and taught myself how to train images over framework/libraries like caffee and tensorflow.
                            </li>
                            <li>At the end after other teams mates involved in integrating and making an android application we were able to achieve 92% accuracy in drunk detection.We had support from our faculties when we got stuck they were always around to ask for.</li>
