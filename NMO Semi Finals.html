                          <li>According to the census in 2011, almost 177 lakh (17.7 crore) people are homeless in India.Which impacts the process of Aadhaar card enrolment as no permanent address is present.
                            (Decrease fraud). The solution by IT to this is a process which allows a Sakshi (witness , who has all supporting documents) person to take a guarantee on the person who wants to enroll for Aadhaar. In case no other person is ready a government employee can take on the Guarantee (Sakshi Mechanism to decrease fraud document or people who does not posse all documents).</li>
                          <li>For maximum awareness to the BPL/Famers or people who needs Government help can be reached via Aadhaar. To leverage that the call centers can be establishes who updates the farmer about farmer related yojnas’.Call center because 17% of smartphone users + 61% cellphone users are present in India. For the remaining 22% the best way is updates on radio. Also the local group leaders + NGO’s + Gram panchayat person’s can be made leaders to make more people aware about the benefits.</li>
                          <li>There are many FAKE Aadhaar card making applications which should be analyzed and banned by government on web or any smartphone platform.(Decrease leakage of information to unauthorized authority).</li>
                          <li>Assuming that you are targeting to scale from a 150 workforce in 2 states with 29 ESU's to lets consider 29 states 2175 workforce 421 ESU's SELCO will need to train the workforce ,so for replication training process symmetrically the computer systems will play a major roles on training at every ESU centers with same kind of training processes also region specific marketing training can also be given leveraging the same.(Decrease the finance cost).</li>
                          <li>Technical check by the supervisor on the Aadhaar enrollment machine from the Desired Quality Check  List given by IT, this will decrease the enrollments done via mall function machines. Even in criteria from the checklist fails, the machine will be returned to technical team.</li>
                          <li>Limiting access to the third party company Example: If a SIM card company needs the Biomatrix proof the system will take fingerprint and acknowledge just Yes /No as answer with photo no other details will be shared.(Decreasing access to data visibility).</li>
                          <li>Third party should not be provided access to write on DB (database)unless and until it is verified by a machine that the person/supervisor is authorized to write in it, by the system via the supervisor’s fingerprints daily.</li>
                          <li>Digitally encrypted tablets will be given to Aadhaar Kendra’s people who all will do job of enrollment of BPL/poor people who can’t be reached digitally. Each Aadhaar person will go to their house and enroll their data in tablet also the same technique can be used if any citizen wants to update their details they can all come at the Nearest Aadhaar Kendra’s and the person will come at their address and update the details.(Service reaches homes for BPL/digitally not reachable people).In that the data can only be uploaded via Aadhar Kendra’s the digital tablet won’t have any interconnection facility/USB/ another connectivity.</li>
                          <li>Currently the Virtual ID can be produced via app launched by UIDAI in which the user can share the Virtual ID instead of sharing the whole Aadhaar number. In addition to that is limiting the time of usage of virtual ID + Information with it.<br>
                             Example: If a user ‘ABC’ generates a Virtual ID he/she should select a time until which that ID would be active so let’s say that its 15 minutes with only my name and address to be shared. (Not all details).</li>
