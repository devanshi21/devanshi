                        <li>Making a community digitally involving the NGO’s and corporates to share their knowledge as a one day for teaching /one day for education in Nation.<b>(Digital leverage)</b></li>
                        <li>Teachers who have gained a senior level experience in their career can teach the primary school teachers about how they can teach more meaning fully and increase the efficiency.<b>(A digital system maintains the log and selection process)(Putting the experience at right place)(To decrease the ratio of 25:1 teacher’s ratio).</b></li>
                        <li>Department of primary education has given a time table which should be followed by every primary school but it seems that many schools do not follow it. Also, the current time table system still has the approach of Industry worker type of learning. Creativity and expansion of there knowledge is still missing.<b>(Excluding the industrial revolution type of time table).</b></li>
                        <li>More interactive learning than just a textbook like 3D models (Wooden/paper) which allows students to look and feel the subjects like Maths, Drawing, Environmental Science. Also they can include the students also to make one for more engagement in studies.<b>(Low cost imagination increasing solution + high engagement).</b></li>
                        <li>While for the subjects like English, Regional language, Maths, Chemistry there should be a solar powered mini projector + speaker + table(As 25% of schools do not possess blackboard). The tablet would be having all aminated/Non-animated video’s in it which would help a child to understand better as many children’s house do not have internet access, this allows them to learn from school.<b>(According to pratham’s annual status 78% child in 3rd STD and 50% in 5th STD can’t yet read 2nd STD text).</b></li>
                        <li>The video can be contributing by Education Industry expert /NGO’s/Corporates on an online portal which can have fresh content every year so that the child can learn new every year. <b>(Online content gathering portal for public use).</b></li>
                        <li>Students should be encouraged to make drawing, painting, maths models, science models, craft, handmade sewing art which would be exhibited in a exhibition held by government every month in which people can buy the same. This would increase their level of thinking and creativity also as it would make them earn, they would be happy to explore as well as their families. This would majorly help the government school kids who are financially not capable it would be one of the sources of income and thus more kids would come to school. <b>(Make, sell and earn Model)(To bridge the gap of practical and theoretical understanding).</b></li>
                        <li>If we follow the 5th point in education teacher would come to know the interest of the child and will feed the data in tablet which can help child to mentor more in future. Similarly, the same information can be passed on to the parent via a call/message about the kid’s progress monthly.<b>(Awareness to the parent about child’s interest).</b></li>
                        <li>The same tablet can be used for attendance using the image processing technology as the teacher clicks just one pic at the end of the class and the code automatically recognizes the child and generated the attendance report.<b>(monitoring system).</b> </li>
                        <li>Also, more complex technology like analytics can also be implemented to see if the child is happy/sad /attentive /not-attentive <b>(Currently can be implement in schools which can afford a surveillance).</b></li>
                        <li>There must be a policy/Bill that if the child whose family comes under less financial conditions(less than 50,000 per year) then the government will pay the family for the basic education.</li>
                        <li>Government money funding monitoring system can be implemented, as it would keep<b> all record of the money to be given to a school by blockchain, and if needed the statement can be made public to be more transparent and money reaches to the desired people and utilize properly.</b></li>
                        <li>As we have tablet in each and every school the data can be collected on DEO’s office and all analytics can be performed which would help for the future planning of a district level schools.<b>(Data used wisely can change the future).</b></li>
                        <li>Competitions can be held like Best school and best teacher which would be given financial aids.<b>(District level)</b></li>
                        <li>Generating a report monthly via data in tablet for every class/school also the usage of government fund can be made public by financial statements to look if the money is used wisely or not.</li>
                        <li>Sport’s competition can be held just like the concept of Khelmahakumbh in Gujarat at district level to encourage all for a fit and healthy as well as to increase the thinking levels.</li>
                        <li>A campaign can be initiated like “Gift a book” to the government school to have a library facility.<b>(60% of the schools do not have access to in school library)</b></li>
                        <li>A system for teacher’s annual test on the subject in which he/she is teaching so that they keep /learning, if the teacher’s fail in the exam they would be penalized.<b>(Improve quality of teaching).</b></li>
                        <li>For food quality, every day a pic of students eating food should be taken with the dish prepared and stored in the tablet.<b> (It will check if the food is served every day and is the standard maintained as told.) (An eye to the food)</b></li>
